# Convenient developer tools

Tools in this folder should only be run via the `make <target>` command.

1. grpc_gen.py => generate grpc code from proto files at any depth.
2. get_data.py => download and extract some sample datasets from the web.
3. cleaner.py => cleans up things like pycache and local installation manifests.

## Future

The above tools will be replaced will Poetry-based scripts in the future (A dev CLI)
